How to test API:

1. Download node.js: https://nodejs.org/en/download/
2. In the command line, navigate to the project folder and type 'npm run server'
3. Navigate to http://localhost:5000/
4. Follow instructions for entering data.

Next, I would create a visualization of the grid, plot the robots with their
battery levels, the load coordinates, and a line connecting the load to its
robot.
